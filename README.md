# Lucas Sequence Generator

This project is a Python application that generates Lucas sequences.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository-name
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

To generate a Lucas sequence, run the `testapp.py` script with the desired number of elements:

```bash
python testapp.py <count>
```

For example, to generate the first 10 numbers in the Lucas sequence:

```bash
python testapp.py 10
```

This will output:
```
Lucas sequence up to 10 numbers: [2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76]
```
